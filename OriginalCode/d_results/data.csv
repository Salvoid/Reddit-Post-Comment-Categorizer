"I put them over/around my glasses. No issues with that. 

I have one of the first generations of Shokz when they were branded as Trekz Aftershokz, audio quality has improved since mine. My opinion on the older stuff is not as good as similarly priced ear buds but plenty good enough. 

I use them mountain biking & skiing and have never thought about wind noise. Although I've never really thought about wind noise doing either of those.",put glasses one first branded audio quality since mine opinion older stuff good similarly priced ear plenty good enough use mountain skiing never thought wind noise although never really thought wind noise either,choosing,,,
"I wear Shokz OpenPros and am almost always wearing my regular ass prescription glasses.  I ride with them, but also use them frequently off the bike.

They do interfere with the glasses, but it's minor, IMO.  I'm generally not bothered by it and can easily forget I'm wearing them, on the bike or off.  I think the interference with the helmet is more significant, but I have a giant head so YMMV.  Wearing them over the straps helps with the comfort.

The audio quality isn't as good as nice ear buds.  But it is good enough that I can make out speech (podcasts, audiobooks, etc).  I mostly use them for music, though.

Wind noise will overpower the audio.  Stiff head winds and fast descents can completely wash them out.

Battery life is good as far as I know.  I keep them charged up, but have never run out on a ride (4-5 hours max).

I'm perfectly happy with them and would get another pair if I lost these.",wear almost always wearing regular ass prescription glasses ride also use frequently bike interfere glasses minor generally easily forget wearing bike think interference helmet significant giant head wearing comfort audio quality good nice ear good enough make speech mostly use music though wind noise overpower audio stiff head fast completely wash battery life good far know keep never run ride perfectly happy would get another pair lost,mountain,,,

"I wear them over my glasses and my friend wears them with glasses and her hearing aids.

The sound quality isn't as good but that's to be expected mainly because you'll be getting a lot of external sound. If you're ears are uncovered then you'll still hear external sound just the same as usual so if there's a lot of background noise then it can become like trying to listen to music in a busy restaurant. Of course the main use for these types of headphones is to be able to hear what's around you at the same time such as when exercising so that's not necessarily a bad thing.",wear glasses friend glasses hearing sound quality good mainly getting lot external sound uncovered still hear external sound usual lot background noise become like trying listen music busy restaurant course main use able hear around time necessarily bad thing,fixed,,,
"I got my wife a set of Shokz open move headphones for Christmas. Shes fine with them with glasses and her helmet. I'd have to look closer to see how she actually aranges it, but it just seems to work.",got wife set open move fine glasses helmet look closer see actually work,running,,,
"1.Most bone conduction headphones are basically worn between the temples, so the fit of the headphones will vary depending on the size of the head. Also, wearing glasses and masks can easily affect their fit. When choosing, you'd better choose those headphones that can be adjusted flexibly.  
Unlike glasses that need to be worn on the ear, bone conduction earphones are worn across the ear, and there are multiple stress points fixed on the head, so they do not strangle the ear.As long as the headphones are adjustable and lightweight, they can basically be paired with glasses for use.  
(TIPS:It is recommended to wear headphones before wearing glasses!)  
  
2.In terms of sound quality, most bone conduction headphones are inferior to common headphones.But some excellent brands, such as Wissonly, Shokz, and Philips, still have good sound quality.  
  
3.Wind noise will overpower the audio. Stiff head winds and fast descents can completely wash them out.This is determined by the ""non-in-ear"" characteristic of bone conduction headphones.  
  
In general, I think bone conduction headphone is an excellent product. It has obvious advantages. It is healthier, safer, and more hygienic. Because of its sound production principle, it is also easy to have a higher waterproof level, so that it can be used in both running, cycling and swimming.  
  
I am a bit fascinated by bone conduction earphones. I have owned two products, the first one is Shokz, and the overall performance is satisfactory. In recent months, I have been using the Wissonly Hi Runner, which has more powerful features compared to previous products: higher waterproof rating, 32GB of built-in storage, and improved sound quality.",bone conduction basically worn fit vary depending size head also wearing glasses easily affect fit choosing better choose flexibly unlike glasses need worn ear bone conduction worn across ear multiple stress fixed head strangle long adjustable lightweight basically paired glasses use wear wearing glasses sound quality bone conduction inferior common excellent still good sound quality noise overpower audio stiff head fast completely wash determined characteristic bone conduction general think bone conduction headphone excellent product obvious hygienic sound production principle also easy higher waterproof level used running cycling swimming bit fascinated bone conduction two first one overall performance satisfactory recent hi runner powerful previous higher waterproof rating storage sound quality,good,,,
Thanks. That's basically what I'm looking for. The wind thing might be a deal breaker though. I'm gonna ride without headphones for a while to feel out how bad wind noise to me then decide.,thanks basically looking wind thing might deal breaker though gon na ride without feel bad wind noise decide,running,,,
Yes. Exactly my thoughts. I have a pair and I do love them. I lost my first pair and I had no second thoughts on purchasing aftershocks for a second time.,yes exactly pair love lost first pair second second time,fast,,,
