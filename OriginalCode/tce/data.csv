"If you care more about durability then I recommend getting a pair of earphones with mmcx or 2 pin connectors (more durable) then connecting it to a wireless bluetooth cable or bluetooth TWS. My old pair lasted over 10 years until I accidentally stepped on it and broke the connector. You can spend pretty big on the earphones because they last pretty much forever unless you physically break them. (I don't sweat much so I don't know if sweat will cause damage). I'm currently using Fiio FH7 and UTWS3.

The bluetooth adapter will last maybe 3 years but it's relatively cheap and you can replace that part. It probably lasts longer than those standalone TWS like airpods, because it has a bigger battery and goes through less cycles.

Downside is that it's more bulky than standalone TWS.",care durability recommend getting pair pin durable wireless cable old pair accidentally stepped broke connector spend pretty big last pretty much forever unless physically break sweat much know sweat cause damage currently adapter last maybe relatively cheap replace part probably longer like bigger battery goes less downside bulky,use,,,

Buds+ are the best Samsung buds for iPhones as they actually brought their wearable app to iOS for it. They seem to have given up on it for the newer buds though,best actually brought wearable seem given though,wireless,,,
"I actually started out with them on a Samsung phone and switched to an iPhone last year. They did integrate more seamlessly with Samsung, but not dramatically so. The main difference is that I had to download the Galaxy Buds app to get them set up and to use the features like Find My Earbud. I've heard that more recent Galaxy earbud models don't have an app that's supported on iphones, but the Buds+ app does work. Oh, and incoming calls will ring through on my earbuds but then switch to the phone speaker automatically - but I've heard that's an iPhone issue that happens even with airpods, so presumably it's not an incompatibility with a Samsung product?

The biggest selling factor for me is the battery life. I was seriously shocked that the battery life has gotten so much worse three* years later (*I said 4 years above, but rechecked my math - I got them in June 2020). I'm guessing it's because newer generations have added features like active noise canceling that takes more battery power? I find the fit is good enough for excellent passive noise canceling, though, and far prefer having double the battery life over active noise canceling. The fact that the battery life hasn't noticeably declined despite 3 years of regular use is also an excellent sign.

When I thought I had lost them earlier this year I did a lot of research. I know the Airpods are what everyone is obsessed with, but I couldn't justify paying that much for something with worse mic quality, worse battery life, and no Find My Earbuds sound alert (I misplace my earbuds all the time, and airpods are too small and too expensive not to have a failsafe way to find out one has rolled behind a trashcan or fallen between couch cushions). And the new Samsung generations had reduced too much in battery life to tempt me. I ended up getting the Jabra Elite 7 Active but was underwhelmed and returned them. They felt much flimsier and the features didn't compare to the Buds+. And then I refound my Galaxy earbuds!
